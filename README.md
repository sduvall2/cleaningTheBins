# cleaningTheBins
Example of applying clean code principles to the Bins project

Compares two algorithms for packing discs with files: 
- Greedy worst fit: Fill the disk with the lowest remaining open space first
- Greedy worst fit, decreasing: Fill the disk with the lowest remaining open space first, but fill from largest file to smallest
